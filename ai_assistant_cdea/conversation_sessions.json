If unchecked, the module will return 0 for all revenue calculations.\n\n2. **Load Curtailment**: The load curtailment value (`drrLoadCurtailment`) is used as the basis for the capacity and energy payments.\n\n3. **Capacity Payment Calculation**:\n   - The module retrieves the peak capacity rate (`PEAK_CAPACITY_RATE`) and off-peak capacity rate (`OFFPEAK_CAPACITY_RATE`) from the `pricingTable` based on the current year range (e.g., '25-26' for year 0, '26-27' for year 1).\n   - The peak capacity payment is calculated as `PEAK_MONTHS * PEAK_CAPACITY_RATE * loadCurtailment`.\n   - The off-peak capacity payment is calculated as `OFFPEAK_MONTHS * OFFPEAK_CAPACITY_RATE * loadCurtailment`.\n   - The total capacity payment is the sum of the peak and off-peak payments.\n\n4. **Energy Payment Calculation**:\n   - The module retrieves the energy rate (`ENERGY_RATE`) from the `pricingTable` based on the current year range.\n   - The energy payment is calculated as `TOTAL_MONTHS * ENERGY_RATE * loadCurtailment`.\n\n5. **Total Revenue**:\n   - The total revenue is the sum of the capacity payment and energy payment.\n\nHere's an example of the JSON configuration for the Emergency Capacity program:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"programName\": \"DRR\",\n    \"loadCurtailment\": 500,\n    \"yearlyRevenue\": 12345.67,\n    \"capacityPayment\": 10000.00,\n    \"energyPayment\": 2345.67\n}\n```\n\nThe key points are:\n- The program name is \"DRR\" (Demand Response Resources)\n- The load curtailment is 500 kW\n- The total yearly revenue is $12,345.67\n- The capacity payment is $10,000.00\n- The energy payment is $2,345.67\n\nThis configuration would be used by the financial projections system to calculate the customer's revenue from the Emergency Capacity program.",

Here are the key details about the EC program:\n\n**Program Description:**\nThe Emergency Capacity (EC) program in PJM pays customers for reducing their electricity usage during emergency events called by PJM. Participants commit to reduce their load by a specified amount and are compensated based on their performance during the events.\n\n**How it Works:**\n- Participants commit to reduce their electricity usage by a certain amount of kW during emergency events\n- PJM calls events with 2-hour advance notice, typically 10-20 hours per year\n- Participants are paid based on their actual load reduction performance during the events\n- Payments are made for both capacity ($/kW-day) and energy ($/MWh)\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n- Minimum 100 kW of curtailable load\n- Must participate in both summer and winter periods\n- Requires interval metering to measure performance\n\n**Rates:**\n- Capacity Rate: Varies by PJM load zone, typically $4-$6/kW-day in the summer and $2-$4/kW-day in the winter\n- Energy Rate: Varies based on PJM energy prices during the event hours\n\nHere is an example JSON configuration for the EC program:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"programName\": \"Emergency Capacity\",\n  \"region\": \"pjm\",\n  \"ecParticipant\": true,\n  \"ecSummerKW\": 500,\n  \"ecWinterKW\": 400,\n  \"ecNotificationTime\": 2,\n  \"ecLoadZone\": \"PENE\",\n  \"ecExcessRate\": 12.50\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration assumes the customer is participating in the EC program, has 500 kW of summer capacity and 400 kW of winter capacity, with a 2-hour notification time. The load zone is set to \"PENE\" and the excess capacity rate is $12.50/MW-day.",

This is because the upstate regions generally have higher reserve margins and less constrained transmission, resulting in lower overall capacity needs and prices.\n\nThe specific upstate zones mentioned in the ICAP-SCR program rates are:\n\n- Zone A: West Central New York\n- Zone B: Genesee\n- Zone C: Central New York \n- Zone D: North New York\n- Zone E: Mohawk Valley\n- Zone F: Capital\n- Zone G: Hudson Valley\n\nThese upstate zones cover the northern and central parts of New York state, outside the major load centers of NYC and Long Island. The capacity rates for these upstate zones range from $1.03/kW-month to $2.06/kW-month for the summer period, and $0.52/kW-month to $1.03/kW-month for the winter period.\n\nThe differentiation between upstate and downstate zones is an important factor in determining the ICAP-SCR program revenues that can be modeled in the CPower Quote Tool, as the rates vary significantly by location within the NYISO footprint.",
