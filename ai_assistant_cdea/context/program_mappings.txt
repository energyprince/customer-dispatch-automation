# CPower Quote Tool - Program Mappings by Region

This document provides a comprehensive mapping of all demand response programs by region to prevent confusion between similarly named programs.

## ISO-NE (New England)
- **ADCR** (Active Demand Capacity Resource) - Capacity program with summer/winter commitments
- **Connected Solutions** - Daily and targeted dispatch programs
- **CapTag** - Capacity tag management (requires ADCR or Connected Solutions)
- **OPHR** (On-Peak Hours Reduction) - Peak hour reduction program with different types
- **Clean Peak** - Clean peak standard program (MA only)

## NYISO (New York)
- **ICAP-SCR** (Installed Capacity - Special Case Resource) - Capacity program
- **CSRP** (Commercial System Relief Program) - Summer reliability program
- **DLRP** (Distribution Load Relief Program) - Local distribution relief
- **NY CapTag** - New York capacity tag management
- **Energy Payments** - Additional energy payments (requires SCR/CSRP/DLRP)
- **DER PM** programs (planned) - Distributed Energy Resource Performance Measurement

## PJM (Mid-Atlantic)
- **Emergency Capacity (EC)** - PJM's emergency capacity program
  - Fields: ecSummerKW, ecWinterKW, ecNotificationTime, ecExcessRate
  - Module: public/regions/pjm/emergency-capacity-module.js
  - NOT to be confused with MDU/MISO's DRR program

## ERCOT (Texas)
- **ERS** (Emergency Response Service) - Emergency response program
- **4CP** (Four Coincident Peak) - Peak reduction program (requires ERS)
- **ECRS** (ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service) - Contingency reserves
- **LRRRS** (Load Resource Reliability Service) - Reliability service

## CAISO (California)
- **Resource Adequacy (RA)** - Capacity program with fixed rates

## APS (Arizona)
- **Peak Solutions** - APS's demand response program

## MDU/MISO (Midwest)
- **DRR** (Demand Response Resources) - MDU's demand response program
  - Fields: drrLoadCurtailment, drrPeakCapacityRate, drrOffPeakCapacityRate
  - Module: public/regions/mdu/drr-module.js
  - NOT to be confused with PJM's Emergency Capacity program

## Key Distinctions

### Emergency Capacity (EC) vs DRR
1. **Emergency Capacity (EC)**:
   - Region: PJM
   - Separate summer/winter kW commitments
   - Has notification time and excess rate parameters
   - Uses "ec" prefix for all fields

2. **Demand Response Resources (DRR)**:
   - Region: MDU/MISO
   - Single load curtailment value
   - Has peak/off-peak capacity rates
   - Uses "drr" prefix for all fields

### Common Confusions to Avoid
- Do NOT confuse PJM's Emergency Capacity with MDU's DRR
- Do NOT confuse NYISO's ICAP-SCR with ISO-NE's ADCR
- Do NOT confuse ERCOT's ECRS with PJM's EC
- Clean Peak is MA-only, not available in other ISO-NE states
- 4CP requires ERS participation in ERCOT

### Field Naming Conventions
Each program uses specific field naming patterns:
- ISO-NE ADCR: adcrSummerLoadCurtailment, adcrWinterLoadCurtailment
- PJM EC: ecSummerKW, ecWinterKW, ecNotificationTime
- MDU DRR: drrLoadCurtailment, drrPeakCapacityRate
- NYISO SCR: icapScrSummerKw, icapScrWinterKw

Always use the correct field names when generating configurations or providing program information.
